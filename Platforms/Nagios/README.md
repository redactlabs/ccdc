# Nagios Baseline Configuration

This directory will include a customized deployment of Nagios
via *.cfg config files to perform both Active and Passive 
Monitoring Checks. 

The Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA) is a great platform
for monitoring service local to the endpoint system that is 
sent encrypted to the central Nagios server. 

This mitigates the need for remote access and offloads the 
monitoring from the Nagios server.
