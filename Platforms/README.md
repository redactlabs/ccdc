# Platforms

CCDC is heavily based on Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS)". Typically,
Open Source platforms will provide a free version that does not require any 
licensing costs and then offer Enterprise Licenses or Support for different 
features/upgrades. 

CentOS is the Open Source version of RHEL and receives the same code base as RHEL, 
but at a different release cycles. It could get pushed down from RHEL within hours 
or up to weeks, but it will eventually reach CentOS. Ultimately, the same reliability 
behind RHEL is made avaialble as a free version and often used for High Availabilty 
Clustering and Virtualization in addition to Appliance Vendors such as FireEYE,
 M86/Trustwave, and Cisco. 

RHEL is certified and heavily tested for being Enterprise ready. It's the operating system
that powers Wall Street and a number of public and private organizations. 

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is now the dominant Linux distribution among exchanges.
Red Hat counts among its customers the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, New York Mercantile 
Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Eurex derivative exchange and Philippine Stock Exchange.
