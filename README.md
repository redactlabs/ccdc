# CCDC

The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is an excellent way for students
intersted in Cybersecurity, to develop the necessary skill sets. 

In Southern California, we are located in the Western Regional CCDC (http://www.wrccdc.org/)
organized by Daniel Manson of Cal Poly Pomona's Center for Information Assurance. 

# Competition Format

This is a detailed breakdown of the competition. 

## Each College/University that competes on their own Blue Team. 
- Blue Teams are purely defensive and the core objects is maintaining
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the uptime of various services
- The secondary objective requires completing randomized tasks known as
Injects, which range from making system/service changes to large projects
such as Centralized Logging, Network/System Monitoring, User migrations 
from Unix/Linux to Windows or vice versa. 
- The third objective pertains to a larger Inject; researching and 
creating a Presentation conducted in front of a panel that includes 
the competition's sponsors (past sponsors include Raytheon, Facebook, Cisco,
Juniper, FireEYE, SpaceX, Tesla, Workday, and SCE). 

## The Black Team (Infrastructure)
- All hardware systems (Servers and Workstations) as well as and network gear 
was "optimized" by the Black Team.
- This will likely include off-site infrastructure such as a VMware
Environment that is at a remote location and require high-level networking
via BGP. 

## The Red Team (Attackers)
- Our friends at the Red Team enjoy disrupting networks, systems, and services.
- Each Blue Team has a one hours grace period before the Red Team can start
attacks (**Note: in the National CCDC, they attack at competition start time). 
- Some Red Team members are more constructive on their feedback over others,
but take as many opportunities to discuss ways to improve and learn from the
Red Team. Just don't get Socially Engineered in the process. 

## The White Team (Points)
- The White Team maintains the Scoring Engine that does randomized checks of 
services as well as judging the attempts/completion of Injects. 
- Always take your time in reading an Inject and then if there's something that
seems ambiguous, contact the White Team. 

## The Orange Team (Customer Support)
- Customer relations inquiries are done via randomized Orange Team members.
- For example, an employee may contact a Blue Team to get a status update on a
service outage and may be irate or unreasonnable with the status.

## Inject Examples
Within this repo, I have a soft copy of injects from the WRCCDC 2011 Invitational (.docx and .pdf formats). This is an excellent reference of the Injects that you may encounter as well as systems and software that you should learn. 

## Help? 
Although my availability is limited, I'll do my best to provide resources or obtain resources from former members. We have a range of professionals that have real world experience working for CSC, Deloitte, Tevora, and Azusa Pacific University.
