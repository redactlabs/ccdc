# Systems

CCDC has used a wide range of operating systems over the years.
Some more obscure than others (random Korean Linux Distro to 
OpenIndiana). One year there was a Linux from Scratch (LFS)
named "Salmon Linux", so it's important to have someone 
versed in Unix/Linux overall.

Here's a list of potential operating systems for workstations or 
servers that may be in the competition. 

* BSD Unix-Like (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenIndiana, pfSense)
* Debian Based (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)
* Other Mainstream Linux: Arch, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, Slackware
* Red Hat Based (Fedora/CentOS/Oracle/RHEL)
* Windows (Server 2003/2008/2012, XP/Vista/7/8/10)
