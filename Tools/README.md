# Tools

For any competition, it's important to have a series of tools 
to deploy and maintain Networks, Systems, Services. This includes
maintaining Cisco Router/Switch/Firewall configurations to 
Web Service and DNS Configurations. 

I'll start with Open Source tools that are typically used in a 
Bash Shell and/or Windows Cygwin Bash Shell. 

## Open Source Tools

* curl (command line network protocol connector)
* bash -x (execute bash scripts in verbose mode)
* cd (change directory) 
* dig (advanced DNS tool)
* echo (display text or append text to a file)
* git (revision control for code/configurations)
* ifconfig (configure network interface)
* ls (list directory contents)
* md5sum (message digest to check file integrity)
* netcat (aka 'nc' or 'ncat' - network socket connector)
* nmap (network port scanner)
* nslookup (DNS tool)
* openssl s_client (SSL/TLS client)
* ping (send ICMP echo to check if a host is alive)
* pwd (print working directory) 
* route (control network routes)
* rsync (remote/local file copying tool) 
* scp (secure copy remote files)
* shasum (check sum for file integrity)
* ssh (secure shell remote access)
* tar (compress/decompress files)
* touch (create text/configuration files)
